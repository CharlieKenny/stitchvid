[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/snapchidu/stitchvid.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/snapchidu/stitchvid)

* Nowadays, with the ever increasing amount of social media content and platforms, digital content is becoming increasingly incoherent and challenging to consume. For example, with popular events/ trends it is typically one post that goes viral and the broader context and narrative regularly gets lost.  This issue becomes even worse with visual narratives - we found that there were almost no coherent and compelling visual narratives across current social media platforms.

* *What if you could create a video narrative around topics with friends?* - Stitch is a web AND mobile app that allows users to create individual crowdsourced videos tagged by topic (e.g. #Wimbledon) and automatically creates an aggregated ‘stitched’
playlist of all videos by topic

* To ensure we could quickly iterate from a solid prototype, we elected to build the back-end around the YouTube IFrame API to handle the heavy mechanics associated with serving video on web and mobile (e.g. upload, storage, encoding, streaming/ embedded player)

* For the MVP we decided against developing a hybrid/ native mobile app in favour of developing a specialised mobile website. Firstly, the mobile website form already satisfied the core user requirement to be able to record footage and upload directly from local video gallery. Secondly, given the deadline of < 2 weeks to develop a presentation ready app, to ensure we produced robust, incremental improvements we did not want to divert significant team resources to exploring a full native app build.

* As a team, we followed Agile, Git workflow and TDD methodologies - created user stories to develop and deliver an MVP and created a waffle.io board to manage tickets >> [Waffle](https://waffle.io/snapchidu/stitchvid).

* To view simply click on the heroku link [Stitch](http://stitchvid.herokuapp.com/) and you can log-in via your Google Plus Account to start uploading videos via your YouTube account. Detailed instructions for local installation below.

* Challenges and proposed improvements - incremental features on our product roadmap include a native/ hybrid app uploader with a greater suite of functionality, user interaction features (e.g. profiles, favouriting videos, following other users) and a custom video architecture to move away from reliance on YouTube API

Use Cases:
-------

```
    - [x] As a user,
          So that I can see the latest videos,
          I want to see a list of videos on the homepage

    - [x] As a user,
         So that I can add to latest videos,
         I want to upload to the app

    - [x] As an admin,
         So that my website doesn't crash,
         I want to store my videos efficiently

    - [x] As a user,
         So that I can see videos by a topic (#hashtag),
         I want to view curated topics on the homepage

    - [x] As a user,
         So that I can add my own interests,
         I want to be able to add my own topics (#hashtags) to homepage

    - [x] As a user,
         So that I can contribute to hashtags I am interested in,
         I want to upload videos directly to a specific hashtag

    - [x] As a user,
         So that I can get a visual narrative of a particular topic (#hashtag),
         I want to be able to stitch videos together

    - [x] As a user,
         So that others don't upload instead of me,
         I want to have to login to upload a video
```

How to run
----

## Local Installation instructions

### YouTube API setup

There are two sets of credentials needed for this application to work.

1) Video processing will not work until you create a YouTube token for authorising general API requests.
To do this go to https://console.developers.google.com/project and create a project,
then in the credentials section select 'Create new key', and copy the resulting
API key using `export YOUTUBE_AUTH_TOKEN='yourkeyhere'`` in ``.bash_profile` then
reload your shell. Without this, uploaded videos will not be published on the site.

2) Log in will not work until you create a YouTube OAuth token pair from the same location, and save
them as env variables YT_CLIENT_ID and YT_CLIENT_SECRET in the same way. You'll need to set a Redirect URI of `https://[yourlocation]/auth/google_oauth2/callback` and a JavaScript origin of `https://[yourlocation]/`. Without
these you won't be able to log into Google and upload videos via the application.

3) You'll need to enable YouTube Data API v3, Contacts API, and Google+ API in the project APIs menu and wait some time for them to become effective as well.

### Local Installation

Set up the Google project for API access, set the enabled URLs to localhost, add the tokens to ~/.bash-profile and reload shell.
```
git clone https://github.com/snapchidu/stitchvid.git
cd stitchvid
bundle
bin/rake db:create RAILS_ENV=test
bin/rake db:create RAILS_ENV=development
bin/rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
bin/rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development
bin/rails s
```

### Heroku Installation from Shell

Based on https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-rails4

Authorise your Heroku account using `heroku auth`, and cd to the local repo in shell.
```
heroku create
git push heroku [yourbranchname]:master
heroku config:set YOUTUBE_AUTH_TOKEN=whateveritis
heroku config:set YT_CLIENT_ID=whateveritis
heroku config:set YT_CLIENT_SECRET=whateveritis
heroku run rake db:migrate
heroku ps:scale web=1
heroku open
```

Also `heroku config` to check config vars, `heroku run bash` to get shell and `heroku -t logs` to get live logging are useful.

To attach a local repo to an existing heroku instance, use `heroku git:remote -a [heroku instance name]`.

Technologies used
----

* Production - Ruby-on-Rails, Javascript, jQuery, Heroku, CSS (using Bootstrap), HTML, YouTube API, Omniauth, PostgreSQL
* Testing - Rspec, Capybara

Further Improvements
----

*  Develop Native/ Hybrid app uploader offering more functionality, video capture and viewing options vs current mobile optimised website

*  User interaction with other users e.g. profiles, favourite videos, follow other users

*  Build custom video architecture e.g. not reliant entirely on YouTube API
